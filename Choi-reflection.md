##Reflections for GPS 1.1##

###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?###
Prior to the GPS session, I could not really conceptualize a merge conflict. I knew ways to prevent it, but did not know what I would do in case of one. Release 5 really cleared that up for me.

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?###
Concepts of using GitHub in a collaborative manner were clarified for me. I was used to using git commands and GitHub for individual work, but never really knew how I would merge other's commits and how I would be notified in that case. I can now clearly see how GitHub is used among group projects.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?###
My pair and I did not have any significant questions towards each other besides some syntax, which we both looked up together. I asked my guide about the command for copying images across directories because I would keep getting errors before. I also asked him about the difference between divs and sections in HTML5.

###What still confuses you about git?###
I think I'm pretty good for now but definitely should practice more commands to get used to the whole git work flow.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?###
My first GPS session went well. I am glad that GPS is an opportunity to test your learning and ask questions. My pair and guide were very nice and great to work with.
